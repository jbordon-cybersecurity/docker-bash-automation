# 🐳 House of the Dockers
A **Bash + Docker automation project** for processing text files across multiple containers.  
Created as part of a scripting and automation module to practice container management, file handling, and workflow automation.

---

## ✨ Features
- Start and manage multiple Docker containers.
- Copy files from host to containers automatically.
- Sort text files by character length and extract meaningful content.
- Generate a final compiled text chapter from multiple sources.
- Interactive menu for viewing, appending, or removing text from the final output.

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Bash scripting**: automation, loops, and user input.  
- **Docker**: container management and file operations.  
- **Text processing**: using `awk`, `sed`, and `wc` for data extraction.  
- **Automation pipelines**: combining multiple scripts into a repeatable workflow.
